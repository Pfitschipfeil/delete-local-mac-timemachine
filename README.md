# delete-local-mac-timemachine
Be careful! This script will delete all your local macOS Time Machine snapshots. I wrote this script because I was annoyed by the fact that I cannot disable local Time Machine backups and my disk keeps running low.  

Usage:  
1. Copy the file "delete-local-timemachine.sh" to a folder you desire
2. Start a **Terminal**
3. Change the directory to the directory where delete-local-timemachine.sh is
4. Type ```bash delete-local-timemachine.sh```
5. The Terminal will ask you for your su (Super User) password
6. **High five** your local Time Machine backups are deleted
